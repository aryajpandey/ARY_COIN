# ARY_COIN

## Overview
ARY_COIN is a cryptocurrency based on Ethereum and created using Solidity. The project aims to provide a decentralized and secure digital currency that can be used for various transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Ethereum and its Forks
Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts. It serves as the foundation for numerous decentralized applications (DApps) and has gained significant popularity in the blockchain space.

Ethereum has had several forks, which are variations or alternative versions of the original Ethereum blockchain. These forks are created to introduce new features, improve performance, or address specific needs of the community. Some notable Ethereum forks include:

- Ethereum Classic (ETC): This is the original version of Ethereum that remained after the hard fork that created Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum Classic is based on the principle of immutability, maintaining the transaction history before the fork.

- Rinkeby: Rinkeby is a test network for Ethereum that allows developers to experiment with DApps and smart contracts without using real Ether. It is often used for testing and development purposes.

- Ropsten: Ropsten is another Ethereum test network that mimics the mainnet, allowing developers to deploy and test their applications in an environment that closely resembles the live Ethereum network.

- Kovan: Kovan is a proof-of-authority (PoA) test network that provides fast and free transactions for developers. It is primarily used for testing and experimentation.

These forks, along with the main Ethereum network, offer a diverse ecosystem for developers and users to engage with blockchain technology.

## Installation and Usage
To use ARY_COIN, you need to have the following installed:

- Ethereum Wallet or a compatible Ethereum wallet software.
- An Ethereum wallet address to send and receive ARY_COIN.

To get started with ARY_COIN:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/aryajpandey/ARY_COIN.git`

2. Set up an Ethereum wallet using compatible software or platforms.

3. Deploy the ARY_COIN smart contract using Solidity to the Ethereum network.

4. Interact with the ARY_COIN smart contract through your wallet to send, receive, or manage your ARY_COIN tokens.

Please note that the specifics of deploying and interacting with the ARY_COIN smart contract may vary based on your Ethereum wallet and development environment.

## Selenium
Selenium is a popular open-source framework for automating web browsers. It provides a suite of tools and libraries that allow developers to write automated tests, perform web scraping, and interact with web applications programmatically.

In the context of this project, Selenium might be used to automate interactions with web interfaces related to ARY_COIN or to create web scraping scripts to gather data from external sources.
